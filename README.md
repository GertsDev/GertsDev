### üåü My mission is to make the world a better place through impactful software.

I build software that transforms complexity into clarity.

With a decade in finance and years in engineering, I design fast, intuitive tools for data-heavy workflows‚Äîturning stock analytics, AI-assisted UIs, and client management into experiences that feel effortless.

As a public advocate for technology‚Äîthrough writing, speaking, and community work‚ÄîI aim to share knowledge, inspire others, and push industries forward. For me, great software doesn‚Äôt just solve problems. It elevates people and reshapes markets.
