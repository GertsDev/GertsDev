# Hey, I'm Kirill Gertsik üëã

I'm a **Frontend Engineer** with a dark sense of humor who moonlights as an **Investment Advisor** and dabbles in **ML & AI Integration**. I build slick, responsive web apps with React, Next.js, and Tailwind‚Äîand occasionally use machine learning to predict which stocks might tank before your morning coffee.

## About Me

- üî≠ **Current Focus:** Building next-gen UIs, optimizing user experiences, and ensuring that no pixel is left unpolished.
- üí° **Skills:** 
  - **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
  - **AI/ML:** Experimenting with ML models to make smarter interfaces
  - **Finance:** Keeping one eye on the market as I code, because why not?
- üå± **Always Learning:** Whether it's the latest JS framework or a new trick in ML, I'm on it‚Äîbecause there's always a better way (or a faster one) to do things.

## How I Work

- **Code Philosophy:** No nonsense, just results. I write clean, maintainable code and I don‚Äôt suffer bloated libraries or over-engineered solutions.
- **Investment Insight:** I merge creative tech with financial acumen, because building digital solutions is great‚Äîbut making smart investments pays the bills.

*‚ÄúIf debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.‚Äù*  
‚Äî At least, that‚Äôs what I tell myself on those caffeine-fueled nights.
